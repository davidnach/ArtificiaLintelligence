Program description :
  q-learn.cpp : Uses q-learning reinforcement technique to train an agent to find the most direct path from all rooms on the 4th floor of cs building at Western Washington University to a particular location on the floor (441 referencing floor plan)
  Grids.java : A visual display of a path being taken by an agent on the 52 x 16 grid used to model the 4th floor. Uses two files produced by q-learn.cpp

  Requirements :
    -g++ compiler version 5.4.0 (other versions may work)
    -Java 8 (other versions may work)

  Usage:
    -There is a bash script provided that will compile and execute both programs.
     To run it we need to give the shell permission to execute the script by using
     the following command : chmod 755 runqlearning

     -to run the script: ./runqlearning

  Notes:
    -The only constants that can be modified are RANDOM_ACTION_LIKELIHOOD
     and GAMMA if other constants are modified the program will not
     produce intended results.
